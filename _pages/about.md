Hello! I am a MS/PhD student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/en) at [Seoul National University](http://en.snu.ac.kr/), working in [Vision & Learning Lab](http://vision.snu.ac.kr/) (advisor: Professor Gunhee Kim). I did my undergraduate studies at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.kaist.edu/).

My research interests include, but not limited to: machine learning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning.
